This is a GitHub Repo for Cohort 7 Git introduction course.

We have covered a number of commands.

Main ones:
- git init/ git clone
- git add . (which means adding all the files -> to be tacked)
- git commit -m "put your message here"
- git push (push to your repo; do it often so that less conflicts, and more synced)
- git pull (pull any updates)

- git revert HEAD (back to the previous one)
- git reset --hard XXXX (force set back to the certain commit u did)
- git checkout -b feature_A (create a new branch, switch to that branch) // git switch feature_A
- git push --set upstream origin feature_A

- git log --graph oneline (see the commit history in one line)
- git reflog (to recover lost commits)
- git rebase main





What we did:
- tried cloning repo
- merge conflicts
- pul requests to push ur branch to main
